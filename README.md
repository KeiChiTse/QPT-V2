## Overview
Quality assessment and aesthetics assessment aim to evaluate the perceived quality and aesthetics of visual content. Current learning-based methods suffer greatly from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform sub-optimally in terms of generalization. Although masked image modeling (MIM) has achieved noteworthy advancements across various high-level tasks (_e.g._, classification, detection _etc._). In this work, we take on a novel perspective to investigate its capabilities in terms of _quality- and aesthetics-awareness_. To this end, we propose **Q**uality- and aesthetics-aware **P**re**T**raining (QPT V2), the first pretraining framework based on MIM that offers a unified solution to quality and aesthetics assessment. To perceive the high-level semantics and fine-grained details, pretraining **data** is curated. To comprehensively encompass quality- and aesthetics-related factors, **degradation** is introduced. To capture multi-scale quality and aesthetic information, **model** structure is modified. Extensive experimental results on 11 downstream benchmarks clearly show the superior performance of QPT V2 in comparison with current state-of-the-art approaches and other pretraining paradigms.
